# TensorFlow / Guild AI Workshop, Nov 2018, Chicago

## Goals

- Introduce AI application development in TensorFlow and Guild AI
- Apply one or more seminal papers to an application workflow
- Contribute back to community projects

## Approach

In this workshop we split into teams of 4-6 people. Each team selects
one paper from a predefined list to work with. Each paper has a
working implementation in TensorFlow.

Each team works collaboratively on these goals:

- Understand the gist of the paper and how the paper advances
  state-of-the-art
- Install and use the paper implementation to reproduce results
- Use Guild AI to automate model operations and document functionality
- Consider ways of applying project in an application
- Time permitting, consider improvements to the implementation project

At their discretion, team members may continue to work with the
project after the workshop, either for application development or to
contribute improvements to the project.

We use this repository to manage source code and coordinate work
activities.

## Preparation

As we only have four hours for this workshop, we will do some work in
preparation.
